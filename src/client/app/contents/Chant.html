                    "Ignore the problem, dwell on the divine, get relieved" is the motto behind such a novel thought. Almost, all possible problems that one could endure during their lifetime have a solution hosted in this app. You just pick your problem and the app will display mantras for you to chant over it with meditation, faith and honesty.

                    <br> And for the religious Tamil mak-kal (Tamil People), as it is specially intended to be in Tamil language this app is a real blessing in disguise for you all. "May God bless you"
